*bio to be uploaded*

### *Treasurer-Elect*, Franci
Sam is a second-year DPhil student in Physics, and MCR treasurer for the year 2012-2013.  Frequently to be seen around college, Sam will manage the MCR accounts for the next year and ensure that the MCR can provide a supportive and enjoyable community within the limitations of its budget.

### *Welfare Officer*, Emily Dolmans
Hey there!  I'm Emily, Welfare Officer for this year. My job is to make sure that everyone stays happy, smiling, and caffeinated. I run a weekly Tea and Cakes session (please let me know if you have cheese requests), and I'm your go-to person if you have anything you want to talk about, or if you just need a hug. I'm currently pursuing a Masters degree in Medieval English Literature, with a focus on outlaw narratives (this doesn't mean that it's okay to nab things from the MCR though!). When I'm not poring over old manuscripts in the library, I enjoy camping, reading experimental novels, and coming up with groan-worthy puns. Apologies in advance. 
 
### *Social Secretary*, Andrew Bissette
Originally from Lancashire, Andrew studied chemistry at the University of Manchester and before coming to Oxford to study at the Systems Biology Doctoral Training Centre in 2010. His research focuses on the role of micellar catalysis in the origins of life. Although chemists are not meant to have interests beyond the fume hood, Andrew enjoys pointless arguments about philosophy, pestering international students about their native languages, and baking (it's science - for hungry people!). When he grows up, he wants to contribute something useful to the world; failing that, he'd like to be Batman. As a social secretary it is his goal to intoxicate you and integrate you into the MCR.

### *Social Secretary*, Birgit Mikus
I'm Birgit, one of your social secretaries for the year 2011-2012. I'm from Germany and in my third year of a  DPhil in, of all things, Modern German Literature (more specifically, political women's writing in the 19th century, if anyone is interested).

Together with Andrew and Yue-Yi I'm responsible for the MCR termcard, including but not limited to bops, exchange dinners, wine and cheese evenings, and any other opportunity we can find to get you lovely people drinking, dancing, and generally having a bit of fun on the side.

### *Social Secretary & Liaison Officer*, Yue-Yi  Hwa
This is Yue-Yi. I’m a first-year MPhil in Comparative Government, and will be writing about authoritarianism in Malaysia (where I’m from) and Singapore (where I did my A Levels). If you don’t know how to pronounce my name you can either pretend you’re saying the acronym for  the Emirates or ask me as many times as is necessary. There’s a good chance I’ll ask for your name again, because I’m not the best with faces. Especially if they belong to people who are taller than me, i.e. 95 percent of the MCR.

### *Sports Rep*, Imogen Parry
My name is Imogen Parry and I'm currently the Exeter House President and the sports rep for the MCR.  As Exeter House President, I run events like the party and film night, while as sports rep I am responsible for the yoga classes and table tennis tournaments.  I'm hoping to run some squash sessions and an MCR-JCR football match in the summer.  I'm well acquainted with Exeter College as I did my undergraduate degree here, in Chemistry, and I'm now in my first year of DPhil.

### *Exeter House President*, Nikita Kaushal
I am Nikita Kaushal and I am from India. For those who know a little
about India, my Mom's from the South and Dad's from the North of
India, they compromised and settled in the middle in a city called
Pune which is close to Mumbai. I finished my Bachelors and Masters in
Pune, majoring in Geology (Yup Geology as in rocks). I worked for an
NGO for a year working with farmers and groundwater and then did
research at Pune University on environmental magnetism for a year
before coming to Oxford. At Oxford I am doing my DPhil in Earth
Sciences - Paleoclimate and Isotopes Group. When I am not getting
educated, I like trying my hand at random games (at present thats
Touch Rugby and Fencing at Oxford), watching movies, travelling and in
general chilling and doing absolutely nothing.

### *IT Officer*, Abhishek Dasgupta
Abhishek is actually an android who is interested in how humans interact with technology, using it to improve their lives and make sense of the world around us. In spare time, Abhishek also takes care of the MCR website and plays table tennis. Previously Abhishek studied physics, but has acknowledged that his nature is better suited to understanding the world using computer science, which Abhishek is happily doing as part of a DPhil.

### *Environmental Rep*, Alistair Hanson
Hullo, I'm Alistair, and I've ended up as Environmental Rep, which
means I am to ensure that the plant remains watered and the rubbish
suitably divided. Originally from Cheshire (the non-footballer bit), I
grew up in various parts of England, with differing levels of Richard
Curtis-style idyllism. I previously studied history, and, after a period
working for the Bodleian Library, shall return to doing so. I like
badgers, penguins, dogs, cheese, hoarding things, and complaining about
the tourists. I am often to be found in the MCR, usually asleep. In my
spare time, I solve crimes, with the assistance of pipe tobacco and my
band of Baker Street Irregulars.

### *Library Rep*, Paola Ferrari

Hi, I am Paola the outgoing Fresher Rep and new Library Rep. As Fresher rep I
organized and coordinated Fresher's week last <abbr title="Michaelmas Term">MT</abbr> and as Library Rep I
represent the the graduate student body (MCR)  at the Library Committee
Meeting.  I am a second Year DPhil student in Physical  and Theoretical
Chemistry studying Soft Condensed Matter and looking at Polyphenols-Polymer
interaction. As many of you may know I have a little boy named Matteo who times
to times show up in the MCR and I enjoy rowing, skiing and running.

### *Freshers' Representative*, Tiffany Chezum
Hey everyone, I’m a second year DPhil student in Archaeology studying the status of indigenous elites in Graeco-Roman Egypt. I’m originally from the Chicago area in the US where I completed a BA in Classics, and I also have an MA in Classics from Queen’s University in Canada. Since joining the Exeter MCR two years ago, and with the experience of two different institutions behind me, I have really come to appreciate the potential of this community to bring together individuals who, as graduate students, are sometimes susceptible to academic isolation. As Fresher’s Rep, I hope to be able to fully perpetuate this inclusive social environment and to pass on the warm welcome I received to the incoming class of Exeter graduates.
